            <h1>Lab 7 Functions</h1>
            <p> Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>We had a little bit of trouble with getting the Task bonus to work but after research about localeCompare(), we were able to figure it out.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>We had a little issue with trying to mimic the css of the name styling but after spending more time adjusting with values, we got it to work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>For this lab, we followed the instructions step by step and made sure we followed them closely. We made sure to complete the bonus tasks since we basically already did the lab in class and it was very fast to complete. The bonus definitely gave us some difficulty but not too much after researching a little bit on what commands can help sort our strings.</p>
